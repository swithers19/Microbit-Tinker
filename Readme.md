# Messing with Microbit - Intro to Hardware

This repository provides a set of examples relating to the Messing with Microbits workshop as part of the SheCodes Plus Program. All examples should be able to be flashed onto a microbit via the [Microbit Python Interface][python-int].

The directories are organised by the functionality of the microbit being explored.
